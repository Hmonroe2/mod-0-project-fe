## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  * The first main point that resonated to me from the video was there are 2 types of mindsets fixed and growth. The fixed mindset is thinking that all your capabilities are set and you cannot change it. The growth mindset means you think you can always grow and change.

  * The second point that resonated with me was that you can have both mindsets for different parts of your life. It is more important to learn to recognize it then it can be to try to change it right away. I think this is very true and it helped me notice habits and mindsets in myself, and instead of falling into them I can recognize and act on them.

  * The third point that resonated with me was knowing when to take a break. Throughout this project and Mod 0, I have been noticing in myself, if I am stuck or frustrated the best thing to do is walk away, take a break, workout or go on a walk. Just to clear my head and attack the problem with a new mindset when I come back. This is something that has been very useful for me.


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  * I think one of the biggest ways I have demonstrated a growth mindset is by applying and enrolling into Turing. These readings have made me realized that at least towards my education and career, I've always had a growth mindset. Ive always said that anyone can do anything as long as they have the will and determination.

  * One major way I am not demonstrating a growth mindset is with my sleeping schedule. I have worked the night shift for the past few years, and now I am having a terrible timing trying to wake up before 10AM. I often find myself going, "I will never be able to get up early". or "I am just so used to getting up after 10AM this is never going to change." The article really helped me notice how this is affecting me. I feel that by even just stating it, I am making progress towards changing this habit.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
  * I really liked this removing some of the specific directions. I think it is very beneficial when learning because it makes you think back and use the knowledge you acquired previously. I also think it does a good job of making us repeat things enough that they become habitual.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  * A conditional statement is how you tell the computer to do either one thing or another. A real life example would be the automatic car windshield wipers. If it is raining the windshield wipers will turn on. If it is not raining the windshield wipers will stay off.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  * To add multiple conditions you can use if statements. After the initial if statement you can us curly brackets '{}' to have the console log a response. Then you can add else if with the second condition and the curly brackets to log a response. You can also use the same process for the third condition. You can use else at the end to say if none of the first three conditions are met, this is the response.

  * The computer reads the first condition and if it is met then the computer will stop there and log the response for  the first condition. If the condition is not met the computer moves on to the second condition. Again if this condition is met the computer will stop there and log the second conditional response. If the first two conditions are not met the computer will run the third condition. The final condition will be reached if all other conditions prove to be false.


6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  * The tools available to developers that allows us to check conditions without running the block of code would be the google development tools that you can access through chrome. By typing `command + option + I || J`. This will pull up the chrome developer tools.


7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

  * The main question I still have regarding if statements if when you use else? Do you have to use `else`? Are there every any conditions that apply to `else` or would those just go under `else if`?
